The main purpose of this application is to reduce the wait time near the billing counter in the grocery stores. We have developed a ‚ÄúMobile Billing‚Äù application that will help you to automatically scan the products that you want to purchase by using QR code scanner that is inbuilt in this application and make the payments for the purchase. This application can be used by customers for self checkout while shopping. The customer downloads the app from the Android Marketplace (Play Store) and scans the items for self checkout without waiting in line to bill items in their cart. It's like having a personal checkout assistant with you always!

<br>

Functional Requirements
------------

- The system shall scan a barcode/QR code of the product and Identify the product and price.
- The system shall display the list of available items.
- Add/Modify Shopping cart items.
- Calculate the totals, taxes and total price.
- Accept payment and complete purchase.

User Requirements
------------

- Mobile Device (With Working Camera)
- Android OS (Version 4.4 or above)

Database Design
------------

For this Application we have used the **Google Firebase** Realtime Database. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime. Realtime syncing makes it easy for your users to access their data from any device, be it web or mobile. Realtime Database also helps your users collaborate with one another. 
<br>
In this NoSQL database, we have created some columns such as description, id, imageURL, name and price where each individual column has its own individual action performed in the database.
<br>
- Description:  It gives a brief introduction about the item.
- id: It is a primary key.
- imageURL: This acts as an image source for the products.
- Name: Name of the product.
- Price: Price of the product.
